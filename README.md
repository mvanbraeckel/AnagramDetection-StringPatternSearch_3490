# AnagramDetection-StringPatternSearch_3490
Analyze and compare efficiency of anagram detection using brute force and presorting (transform-and-conquer) methods. Also, do the same for searching a document for string pattern using brute force, Horspool's, and Boyer-Moore's algorithmic solution (Analysis and Design of Computer Algorithms course A3)
