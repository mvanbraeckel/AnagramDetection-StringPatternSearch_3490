or may be obtained from the Senate Office or the office ofany chair or dean.
Students who have been found guilty of a course-based offence and who have
a penalty in addition to an Official Warning will not be permitted to dropthe
or to withdraw with failure. A student who has dropped the course priorto the
being detected will have his/her enrolment in the course reinstatedif found
and if the penalty assessed is other than an Official Warning. 3. Students who
been suspended for academic misconduct will not receive creditfor any courses
while under suspension. This policy applies to any credit coursetaken during
suspension period, be it distance, or non-campus, taken in openlearning
at the University of Guelph or at another post-secondary institution.In
in the case of graduate students, any research or writing completed duringthe
period may not be submitted in fulfillment of program requirementsonce the
of suspension is concluded. 4. A student who wishes to be considered for
after a suspension must makean application that will be judged on the basis of

associated penaltiesconsecutively. 5. A student who has been expelled from the
of Guelph is not eligible forreadmission to the University for at least five
A student who wishes to beconsidered for readmission must petition the

Enrolment Services. Admissions University of Guelph students may, at some
be required to complete and submit anapplication form to the Admission
Office. The two most common reasons forsubmitting this internal application
are: to apply to transfer from one degree programto another or to apply for
to a program. Application forms must be submitted to Admission Services by the
dateestablished for each semester. An application fee is payable at the time
application issubmitted (refer to Section III--Schedule of Dates.).
deadline dates are published in Section IV--Admission Information. Associated
Requirements Program Committees have the option of identifying, as
for graduation,program components that are not academic courses and do not
an academic creditweight. Associated Program Requirements allow programs to
formal recognition(but not academic credit) to the successful completion of
components that areprimarily non-academic but are judged by the program
as essential to fulfilthe objectives of a degree or diploma program.
Program Requirements, whenvalid, are identified in Section X--Degree Programs
the schedule of studies for eachappropriate area of study. Attendance at Class
will inform students of the attendance requirements for individual courses
with the policy of the department or school. Caution: A student who for any
does not attend classes regularly, runs the risk ofbeing unable to complete
work of the semester and is advised to report to the programcounsellor for
counselling upon return to classes. Auditing Courses A student may audit a

and added, or grades are received,the class level may be adjusted accordingly.

Failed Courses In general, a student who is eligible for continuation of study
the program but has failedto gain standing in one or more of the courses
will be required to repeat thecourse(s) or take an alternative credit. Note:
a failed course attempt remains on thestudent record even if the course has
repeated successfully. However, the Universityrecognizes that there may be
where it is unreasonable for the student to repeat thecourse to make up for
lost credit. Therefore, the Academic Review Sub-Committee may, if appropriate
feasible, andonly under special circumstances, allow a student the opportunity
gain credit for a failedcourse by granting a supplemental privilege. The
Review Sub-Committees will consider granting a supplemental privilegein the
special circumstances: 1. the course is failed in the graduating semester (if
supplemental privilege is grantedand successfully completed, convocation will
likely be deferred until thefollowing semester); 2. the failed course is not
to the student within the following three semesters,or within a time period
includes the graduating semester; 3. the course is of such a nature that there
no permissible substitute or alternativeavailable to the student within the
three semesters, or within a time periodthat includes the graduating semester;
4. the course is a required two-semester course that cannot be taken and
the following three semesters, or within a time period that includes

A notation of "P"or "F" will be shown beside the original failing grade to

(P) or not (F). Multiple Failure Limitations Students should note that some
limit the number of times a student may repeatfailed courses. A student may
be permitted to continue in his/her major and/or programshould they fail the
course, or its equivalent, multiple times. Multiple failurelimitations are

System Two-semester courses constitute two course attempts and will appear as
on thestudent academic record. These courses are indivisible and the same
will apply foreach attempt. A refined grading system was approved by Senate on

may be a grade increase, agrade decrease, or no change to the grade. The
of errors or omissions in thecalculation of final grades will result in the
of a revised grade. Studentsnormally initiate grade re-assessments, but
may initiate this process. However,instructors must NOT use the grade
process to: grant extensions for submission of work beyond course grade

the chair of the department offering the course no later than the 10th class
of thesubsequent semester. The request must pertain to work completed during
semester.Students must also submit relevant assignments or tests that have
returned to them. The chair shall forward the student's request to the

Grades A student may request a grade reassessment on the basis of the Methods
Criteria usedin establishing the final grades in a course. Methods or Criteria
